            <h1>ABOUT ME!</h1>
            <p>My name is Vincent and I am a software developer. I didn&apos;t start out as one though!</p>
            <p>I originally had grand hopes of a career in law, but some self-discovery after university led to the realisation that law and accounting was&apos;t it.</p>
            <p>Over the COVID-19 lockdowns, I took the time to study to make a pivot. I am now, fortunately, employed as a junior developer.</p>
            <p>There&apos;s, of course, still more to learn, more goals to meet and more people to meet.</p>
            <p>So please, feel free to reach out! Otherwise, just have a look around! I do more than just code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
            <p>Like pixel art! I am proud of making and forcing some of them into this site!</p>
        </div>
