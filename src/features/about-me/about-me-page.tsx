            <p>My name is Vincent and I am a software developer. I didn&apos;t always start out as one though!</p>
            <p>I originally had grand hopes of a career in law, but some self-discovery revealed that it was not a path I wanted to take.</p>
            <p>Over the COVID-19 lockdowns, I took the time and studied to make a pivot. I am now, fortunately, employed as a developer.</p>
            <p>There&apos;s, of course, still a lot to learn, more opportunities to take and more people to meet.</p>
            <p>So please, feel free to reach out, or otherwise, just have a look around! I do more than just code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
            <p>Disclaimer: I prepared all assets on this site</p>
        </div>
